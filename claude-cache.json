    "editedText": "The primary objective of this comprehensive laboratory investigation was to systematically examine and analyze the enzymatic digestion of macromolecules by studying the specific activity, kinetic properties, and optimal conditions of key digestive enzymes that play crucial roles in human metabolism. Three distinct experimental procedures were carefully designed and conducted to thoroughly analyze the breakdown of different macromolecule types: first, the digestion of starch polysaccharides by α-amylase enzyme, second, the hydrolysis of lipids and fats by pancreatic lipase, and third, the proteolytic cleavage of proteins by trypsin protease. Based on established biochemical principles and previous research findings, we hypothesized that each enzyme would demonstrate specific substrate specificity and that their catalytic activity would be influenced by environmental factors such as pH, temperature, and substrate concentration, with each enzyme exhibiting optimal performance under physiologically relevant conditions that mirror those found in the human digestive system.",

    "editedText": "The regulation of digestive enzyme activity is crucial for maintaining proper digestive function. Specific inhibitors such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) irreversibly inhibit serine proteases by covalently modifying the active site serine residue (Fahrney and Gold, 1963). Natural protease inhibitors, including soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI), provide competitive inhibition by binding to the enzyme's active site (Kunitz, 1947). Based on established biochemical principles, we hypothesized that: (1) α-amylase would effectively digest starch under neutral conditions but would be inhibited by acidic pH and heat denaturation, (2) pancreatic lipase would digest fats more efficiently in the presence of bile salts, producing detectable fatty acids, and (3) trypsin would demonstrate measurable proteolytic activity that could be inhibited by both PMSF and soybean trypsin inhibitor.",

    "editedText": "Lipid digestion primarily occurs in the small intestine through the action of pancreatic lipase, which hydrolyzes triglycerides into monoglycerides and free fatty acids (Lowe, 2002). The efficiency of lipid digestion is significantly enhanced by bile salts, which act as biological detergents to emulsify fats and increase the surface area available for enzymatic attack (Borgström, 1980). The release of fatty acids during lipolysis results in a decrease in local pH, which can be monitored using pH indicators (Armand et al., 1999). Protein digestion involves multiple proteolytic enzymes working in concert to break peptide bonds. Trypsin, a serine protease secreted by the pancreas, specifically cleaves peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of basic amino acids (lysine and arginine) (Hedstrom, 2002). The enzyme is synthesized as an inactive zymogen (trypsinogen) and activated by enterokinase in the duodenum to prevent autodigestion (Neurath, 1984). Trypsin activity can be measured using synthetic substrates such as benzoyl-DL-arginine p-nitroanilide (BAPNA), which releases p-nitroaniline upon hydrolysis, producing a measurable color change (Erlanger et al., 1961).",

Experiments analyzed starch digestion by α-amylase, fat digestion by pancreatic lipase, and protein digestion by trypsin. We hypothesized enzyme activity would be optimal under physiological conditions and inhibited by extreme pH, heat, or specific inhibitors. Starch digestion was assessed using Benedict's and Lugol's tests, fat digestion monitored through pH indicator changes, and protein digestion quantified by measuring absorbance of a synthetic substrate. Results showed α-amylase effectively digested starch under neutral conditions but was inhibited by acidic pH and heat. Pancreatic lipase digested cream with bile salts, producing fatty acids that lowered pH. Trypsin activity was confirmed through increasing absorbance, while PMSF and soybean trypsin inhibitor",
